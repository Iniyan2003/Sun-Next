# Sun-Nxt
I have developed the Backend for the Sun Nxt Application

## Platform Used
### Back-End
  (i) Java <br>
  The Sun Nxt app's backend is crafted with Java, a powerful and adaptable programming language. The selection of Java is based on its platform independence, object-oriented characteristics, and widespread community backing. The codebase adheres to best practices and design patterns, ensuring both maintainability and scalability.
  
  (ii) MySQL <br>
  The Sun Nxt app utilizes Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage its database. SQL serves as a standardized language for interacting with relational databases, providing a robust and effective means of data handling. Within the backend, SQL queries are employed to execute operations such as data retrieval, insertion, and modification.
